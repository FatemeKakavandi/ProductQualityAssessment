# ProductQualityAssessment
In this project, We employ and compare two models, namely One class classifier and binary classifier, using Support Vector Machine. The models are trained and tested on Medical device assembly processes. The results and explanation of this project is provided in the paper entitled "Product Quality Control in Assembly Machine under Data Restricted Settings". The reader can read the paper via this [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9976173). However the data is not available, the user can employ other dataset to evaluate and compare the output these models. In the following you can see the implementation of the methodology on a public dataset:

We generate normal and abnormal samples via sin function. These samples are demonstrated as bellow:

For hyperparameter tuning, we use a One-Anomaly-Out approach.

# ProductQualityAssessment
In this project, We employ and compare two models, namely One class classifier and binary classifier, using Support Vector Machine. The models are trained and tested on Medical device assembly processes. However the data is not available, the user can employ other dataset to evaluate and compare the output these models.

For hyperparameter tuning, we use a One-Anomaly-Out approach.
